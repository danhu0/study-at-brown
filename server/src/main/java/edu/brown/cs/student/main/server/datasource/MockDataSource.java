However, it has potentialities for future new construction, since it lies adjacent to new developments of a very high character in Summit. This has already spread into the Borough of New Providence along Mountain Avenue, which is rolling, wooded, and scenic countryside. Another potentially favorable factor for this part of the area is that the Bell Telephone Laboratories within the past ten years acquired a tract of about 200 acres along Mountain Avenue near the Summit line, and intend some day to establish experimental laboratories there which will undoubtedly be accompanied by high grade home construction to house officials and technicians. Several houses in the $25,000 class and upwards are now located in this vicinity. The north side of the area is also sparsely settled, but with smaller type homes of sound construction. The land here is gently rolling, and being close to Summit, has definite future possibilities for residential development. Schools and churches are within the area, but shopping is mostly done in Summit Center, two to three miles distant. The main streets are hard surfaced, and Springfield Avenue is the principal thoroughfare. All city facilities are available, except that the sewerage system does noe extend to vacant or very sparsely settled parts.\\\",\\\"9\\\":\\\"Borough of New Providence 2nd B1 1-1-39\\\",\\\"10\\\":\\\"H59\\\",\\\"71\\\":\\\"9\\\",\\\"72\\\":\\\"$48.80\\\",\\\"2n\\\":\\\" 1939 $35-45 0%\\\",\\\"2e\\\":\\\" 97%\\\",\\\"4b\\\":\\\"10\\\",\\\"2k\\\":\\\" Firm\\\",\\\"1c\\\":\\\" Nil\\\",\\\"2j\\\":\\\"Fair \\\",\\\"2b\\\":\\\" Frame\\\",\\\"2f\\\":\\\" 85%\\\",\\\"2o\\\":\\\" Fair\\\",\\\"2i\\\":\\\"1939 (See notes below) $5500-6500 0%\\\",\\\"2m\\\":\\\"0% $35-45 \\\",\\\"1d\\\":\\\"0%\\\",\\\"4a\\\":\\\"3\\\",\\\"1a\\\":\\\" Slow \\\",\\\"2c\\\":\\\"8-10 years \\\",\\\"2l\\\":\\\"$35-45 \\\",\\\"1e\\\":\\\"None\\\",\\\"2a\\\":\\\" 1-family 6 rms\\\",\\\"5b\\\":\\\"3\\\",\\\"1b\\\":\\\"Businessmen - Clerks - Jr. Executives\\\",\\\"2h\\\":\\\"$5500-6500 0\\\",\\\"2g\\\":\\\"$5500-6500 \\\",\\\"2p\\\":\\\" Firm\\\",\\\"5a\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"2d\\\":\\\" Good\\\"},\\\"city\\\":\\\"Union Co.\\\",\\\"holc_grade\\\":\\\"B\\\"},\\\"type\\\":\\\"Feature\\\"},{\\\"geometry\\\":{\\\"coordinates\\\":[[[[-74.346782,40.67031],[-74.346699,40.668486],[-74.346476,40.668345],[-74.350204,40.665022],[-74.353506,40.667211],[-74.353678,40.667489],[-74.354265,40.667898],[-74.356857,40.669567],[-74.360917,40.672016],[-74.363535,40.673593],[-74.366861,40.670717],[-74.369772,40.672684],[-74.365418,40.676357],[-74.362434,40.678861],[-74.356784,40.675337],[-74.351427,40.680605],[-74.346878,40.678063],[-74.350005,40.674767],[-74.349161,40.674189],[-74.34966,40.673717],[-74.349856,40.671042],[-74.348164,40.671447],[-74.346782,40.67031]]]],\\\"type\\\":\\\"MultiPolygon\\\"},\\\"properties\\\":{\\\"area_description_data\\\":{\\\"0\\\":\\\"Union County, New Jersey\\\",\\\"2\\\":\\\" 100\\\",\\\"3\\\":\\\"Moderately 20 1-family $6000-9000\\\",\\\"5\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"6\\\":\\\"FHA\\\",\\\"8\\\":\\\"This is an outlying, sparsely settled residential community adjacent to and north of the Town of Westfield. The land is rolling and wooded, and only about 20% built up. Mountain Avenue at the south boundary line of the area is a main thoroughfare (Route 29) from Newark to New York. Bus transportation is fair, but it is only a little over a mile to the Westfield Station of the Central R.R. of N.J. Being a small town, no sewage system has been installed, and there is only a volunteer fire department. Nevertheless it is considered a desirable residential section by the white-collar business people living there because it has many favorable features. Among these are: quiet woodland (except along the highway at the edge of the area) with practically no traffic directly through the area, Watchung Reservation to the north, Echo Lake Park to the south (prepared well maintained picnic and playgrounds) Echo Lake Country Club proximity to Westfield (a highly desirably residentail community with fine shopping facilities) adequate schools and churches. New building construction is of a very good character. There are no row houses, and the planning is good. During the course of construction, as much of the natural beauty of the woodland is retained as possible. Houses are somewhat older and less desirable than the average along New Providence Rd., and on Central Avenue.\\\",\\\"9\\\":\\\"B-21 2nd+ 1-1-39 Mountainside\\\",\\\"10\\\":\\\"U56\\\",\\\"71\\\":\\\"9\\\",\\\"72\\\":\\\"43.4\\\",\\\"2g\\\":\\\"4500-8000 \\\",\\\"1b\\\":\\\"White-collar business people\\\",\\\"2c\\\":\\\"10 years \\\",\\\"2h\\\":\\\"12 5000-9000 \\\",\\\"1e\\\":\\\"None\\\",\\\"1c\\\":\\\"- Nil\\\",\\\"2d\\\":\\\" Good\\\",\\\"2b\\\":\\\"Frame - Brick \\\",\\\"2m\\\":\\\" 35-55 13 \\\",\\\"2k\\\":\\\" Firm\\\",\\\"2j\\\":\\\" Fair (for new homes especially)\\\",\\\"2o\\\":\\\" Good\\\",\\\"2n\\\":\\\"0 35-55 1939\\\",\\\"5b\\\":\\\"10\\\",\\\"5a\\\":\\\"1\\\",\\\"2e\\\":\\\"95% \\\",\\\"2f\\\":\\\"90% \\\",\\\"4a\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"2i\\\":\\\"-11 4500-8000 1939 Nominal\\\",\\\"2l\\\":\\\"30-50 \\\",\\\"2p\\\":\\\"Firm \\\",\\\"1a\\\":\\\" Slow \\\",\\\"4b\\\":\\\"10\\\",\\\"2a\\\":\\\" 1-family 6-8 rms.\\\",\\\"1d\\\":\\\"0\\\"},\\\"city\\\":\\\"Union Co.\\\",\\\"holc_grade\\\":\\\"B\\\"},\\\"type\\\":\\\"Feature\\\"},{\\\"geometry\\\":{\\\"coordinates\\\":[[[[-74.435244,40.687211],[-74.438258,40.683769],[-74.43827,40.682375],[-74.43797,40.670369],[-74.429989,40.671156],[-74.426724,40.672109],[-74.424828,40.673319],[-74.420361,40.676081],[-74.413192,40.680493],[-74.412554,40.67944],[-74.411371,40.680237],[-74.410001,40.678985],[-74.417846,40.674344],[-74.424678,40.670344],[-74.426217,40.669476],[-74.429464,40.668778],[-74.431021,40.668679],[-74.435676,40.668252],[-74.439129,40.667953],[-74.445942,40.667341],[-74.44628,40.671384],[-74.446468,40.674017],[-74.446768,40.679753],[-74.452586,40.684137],[-74.452155,40.68583],[-74.451629,40.686613],[-74.450634,40.686855],[-74.449771,40.686727],[-74.448682,40.686243],[-74.447706,40.686272],[-74.44735,40.686357],[-74.446524,40.687111],[-74.446149,40.687681],[-74.445041,40.688079],[-74.444159,40.688307],[-74.443127,40.688719],[-74.440819,40.689346],[-74.439711,40.689644],[-74.43896,40.690185],[-74.438191,40.691167],[-74.437684,40.691765],[-74.437159,40.691893],[-74.436652,40.691993],[-74.433499,40.689687],[-74.433405,40.689474],[-74.435244,40.687211]],[[-74.447221,40.682508],[-74.446025,40.680613],[-74.440782,40.68257],[-74.442194,40.684507],[-74.447221,40.682508]]]],\\\"type\\\":\\\"MultiPolygon\\\"},\\\"properties\\\":{\\\"area_description_data\\\":{\\\"0\\\":\\\"Union County, New Jersey\\\",\\\"2\\\":\\\" 100%\\\",\\\"3\\\":\\\"10 1-family $4000\\\",\\\"5\\\":\\\"2\\\",\\\"6\\\":\\\"Limited\\\",\\\"8\\\":\\\"A remote and sparsely settled section at the extreme western end of Union County.
